# ChatMD

[ChatMD](https://chatmd.forge.apps.education.fr/) is a free, open-source tool that enables you to create custom chatbots from simple Markdown files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Create a publicly accessible Markdown file
2. Format it using ChatMD's syntax to define your chatbot behavior
3. Access your chatbot instantly at: `https://chatmd.forge.apps.education.fr/#URL` (Replace `URL` with your file's URL)

While the basic syntax is straightforward, ChatMD offers advanced configuration options for sophisticated use cases: interface customization, variable implementation, randomized responses, Large Language Model integration, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities.
